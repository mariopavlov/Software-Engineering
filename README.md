# Software Engineering

A mono repository for various Software Engineering problems and exercises.

I use this repository to collect programming solutions and as sandbox to investigate new language concepts.

The repository is divided into sub-folders based on topics:
- Algorithms (`\algorithms`)
- Design Patterns (`\design-patterns`)
- Programming Languages (`\languages`)
- Concurrent Computing (`\concurrency`)
